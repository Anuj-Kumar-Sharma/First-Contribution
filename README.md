Hi this is Sheikh learning GIT 
here are some basic `git` commands

`git init` : 
  Create empty Git repo in specified directory. Run with no arguments to initialize the current directory as a git repository.

`git clone <repo>` : 
    Clone repo located at <repo> onto local machine. Original repo can be located on the local filesystem or on a remote machine via HTTP or SSH.

`git config user.name <name>` :
    Define author name to be used for all commits in current repo. Devs commonly use --global flag to set config options for current user.

`git add <directory>` :
    Stage all changes in <directory> for the next commit. Replace <directory> with a <file> to change a specific file


`git commit -m "<message>"`:
    Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use <message> as the commit message

`git status` :
    List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked.

`git log` :
    Display the entire commit history using the default format. For customization see additional options.

`git diff` :
    Show unstaged changes between your index and working directory.
